### Overview
The Aegis Avenger Stalker is a civilian light fighter that is popular among bounty hunters. It was initially the frontline carrier ship for the UEE military, then it had a long and storied career as the standard patrol craft of the UEE Advocacy. Utilizing its cargo hold for prisoner transport, the Avenger features a sturdy, reliable hull and the capacity for larger-than-expected engine mounts. The Stalker is manufactured by Aegis Dynamics, a Human spacecraft manufacturer based on Cestulus. Today, the company is a major manufacturer of both civilian and military crafts. The Avenger has 3 other variants, the EMP Warfare Warlock, the Base Lite Cargo Hauler Titan, and the Titans Limited Edition Variant the Renegade. As of today, the Stalker is for sale, and upgrade on the pledge store for $60. And is also available in the “Avenger Stalker Starter Pack” game package for $75. It is also available to citizens who reach 25 Referral points. Speaking of RP points thank you guys for using and sharing my code. It saved me the cost of having purchase this for a review. Because I know people will ask ships labeled for arena commander appear in the retrieval console but not in the RSI hangar.

[comment]: <> (It is available as a loaner to Aegis Merchantman Owners alongside the Drake Caterpillar, By the way this is a great package)
And The Stalker is available for sale at Lorville’s new deal for over 880,000 aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Aegis Avenger Stalker let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. On the nose you’ll notice the massive size 4 hardpoint with a gimballed size 3 gatling equipped. Above and to the right of this we have direct access to the cockpit. Under the wings we can see a gimballed size 2 laser cannon and a pair of size 2 missiles. Walking around the winglets we see the blue accent lighting that I’m quite a fan of. Around the back we have the cargo hold. Other than a different pair of missiles the starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's climb inside. The cargo hold of the Stalker trades its SCU cargo space for 6 holding cells. Past the cargo hold you have the living quarters with a bed on the port side and some spaceship stuff on the starboard side. In between the living quarters and flight deck, there are some unmarked component housings. Let's head toward the flight deck. The Stalker does not have the new building blocks UI HUD yet. There are 3 MFDs and a 2D Radar. The stalker does feature an ejection system. And it has an exit straight from the flight deck.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, all of the pertinent avenger variants, popular light fighters, and bounty hunting ships. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The Avenger Stalker weighs in at over 50,000kg | 5th Place
* It fits in at 23m in length | Ties in 5th Place with the avenger series
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | Ties in Last with half of the ships on this list
* Has a Max Crew Size of 1| Ties in Last place with most of the ships on this list
* Carries 583qfu | Ties in Last place again with everything except the cutty series
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 184m/s | 7th Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,307m/s | 2nd Place
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 65d/s | 4th Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 65d/s as well | 4h Place
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 120d/s | Ties in 6th Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of just over 6,000 | Ties in 6th place
* It shoots peas with a Default Pilot DPS of 908 | Ties in last place, Checkout my loadout guide to fix this
* The cutty series are the only ships on this list with turrets.
* It slings pooh with a combined missile payload of over 14,000 | 9th Place
* And the Avenger Stalker is available for sale in-game for almost 900,000aUEC | And takes the 2nd spot.

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are
* Obviously Its blazing fast max speed
* Its Pitch and Yaw rates are decent
* It has Space to hold passengers and mission boxes. You can even store them in the prisoner cells to ensure they dont fall out
* It has a bed to log out in. But in the current state of the game when you come back you may be locked in the cabin. I CTD'd and had this happened and I just waited a few min and the ships doors became operational again. ha I was a prisoner in my own poisoner ship
* Has 2 exits for added flexibility, this is great if you need to get our in a hurry or get in from the front
* It has great damage potential with the size 4 hardpoint on the nose, especially when 3.10 makes fixed weapons viable again.
###### For cons, I'd say...
* Although its max speed is pretty fast its SCM speed is quite low this means if you travel over that speed your coolers and thrusters will overheat sooner and cause degradation when that comes into the game. Further more in the upcoming 3.10 patch when SCM speed will put the least amount of strain on your thrusters you will be incentivized to stay under this speed to be most effective in combat.
* Its missile payload is pretty disappointing with just 4 size 2 missiles
* And If you are considering this for a starter ship there is 0 Cargo space, vs the base model titan's 8 scu.


### My Thoughts
Alright so SubliminaL what are your thoughts? I’ll just get straight to the point. There is absolutely no reason to own this ship right now. When a player can profit from taking live bounties it will be a totally different situation. Now you may be wondering why i'm saying this when this ship is better than the avenger titan in almost every way except one. That is its lack of cargo space. And if you want to give that up to add to your combat abilities then this would serve it purpose well. However the reason why I don't think anyone needs to own this ship in the games current state has nothing to do with the Stalker but the next and final variant of the avenger series the Warlock. The warlock has almost the same stats as the Stalker but instead of losing the cargo space for currently useless prisoner cells you gain an EMP. Adding a whole new dynamic to your gameplay. Now when we have the full bounty hunting gameplay loop implemented into the game the stalker will be an awesome must have ship if you want to get into that gameplay especially if you don't want to break the bank. If you are outgrowing the combat capabilities of your avenger titan, then look toward the 325a. You will only loose 4scu of cargo, gain more amenities, keep the same type of firepower, And excel at every other speed and combat metric over the titan. Its a win win.
