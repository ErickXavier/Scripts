#### Overview
The Aegis Avenger Stalker is a small two-seat combat ship utilized by the Aegis to provide protection and fly alongside the Merchantman, so its design includes a much improved range over other fighters of similar size due to its fuel intakes. Its design features both Xi’an thrusters, Tevarin shields, and four Singe tachyon cannons. As a result, with a light-weight hull, it allows the ship to be agile and fast. Though cargo space is limited, the Avenger Stalker features modest accommodations for its crew and provides easy access to components.

Although the shape, hull, and design of the Avenger Stalker remains consistent across all Avenger Stalker models, features can be different from different manufacturers. These features are based on the Human export model manufactured by Jannue Mon-Li.

The Avenger Stalker Editions Include, the base you'll be seeing today, this sweet looking Pirate Edition, and the hideous Limited Edition Best In Show sold during the 2949 International Aerospace Expo.  The only difference between the three is the paint.

As of today, the Avenger Stalker is for sale on the pledge store for $220 Standard, and $200 Warbond. It is available as a loaner to Aegis Merchantman Owners alongside the Drake Caterpillar, By the way this is a great package and comes highly recommended by me the price for this will surely go up the next time this is sold. Speaking of loaners if you own a Avenger Stalker you get a Sabre as a loaner. I think this is due to the Singe bug but i'm not 100% sure. The Aegis Avenger Stalker is not available for sale in game. Now that we know a little bit more about the Avenger Stalker, let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you’d like to skip this tour, the timestamp is on screen and in the description. Aesthetically the Avenger Stalker is a beautiful ship. I love the gold foil look. It looks like something a tomb raider might find on a wall in some ruin. On the wing tips here we have this bubble light that could be a sensor or maybe like some sort of communication device via its pulsating light. I'm not sure, let me know in the comments if you know what these are for. This is not the stock loadout by the way. Under the arms we have size 3 hardpoints that come with gimbals stock. Here you can see this awesome Aegis design style that makes you think the ship might be alive. It has very organic lines. Underneath we have 2 more size 3 hardpoints also gimballed. Further toward the back we have 2 size 2 missile racks. Again these missiles are from my loadout. This design style is so unique. Here you can see the black underside looks kinda like carbon fiber. More of that organic feel here with these legs, look at the feet. Around back we have its dual main thrusters. And from here we can see why it has the nickname space crab.

### Interior
Let's step up inside. This egress point seems like it would be easy to defend. On the starboard slide we have a bed to log out in. The co-pilot gun rack can be found here. Here the organic look is cranked to 100. I feel like I've been  swallowed up. I think components will be stored here when they become physicalized. The portside also has a bed to log out in. Let's step up to the pilot seat. I wonder if you right hand drivers would call this the co-pilot seat. Here we can see the building block UI is not in yet. But we should be getting that next patch. It has a 2d radar and 4 MFDs. The Avenger Stalker does have an ejection feature. Almost forgot the pilot has a gun rack as well. The co-pilot seat is identical to the pilot seat. Just an FYI you can fly this ship from either one of the seats there really is no difference.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, mostly other light fighters. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are
* It has room for, mission boxes, 1 friend as a co-pilot, and Lots of people in the cabin
* Amenities like a two beds to log out in and weapon racks
It has a massive amount of quantum fuel capacity, so you can equip the less efficient but fast VK-00 and still make it from one end of stanton to the other in one tank.
* Stock loadout is pretty good there isn't much that needs to be changed.
Its damage potential is pretty good as well we've got 4 size three hardpoints that in line with the sabre.
* It's also great for box missions because of its size and design. You could pull into a hangar and fly right up to the door.
* And if you haven't seen my loadout guide. One of the best things about the Avenger Stalker is its Sukoran shield generator. It has a 100% minimum physical absorption. This means that even with the shield penetrating ballistic fire the shields have to be brought down completely in order for your hull to take damage. This is at the cost of a pretty long 18s damage regen delay however adapting your playstyle to this shield can produce some great results. Also if you don't like that playstyle and go with something like the FR-76 you can put that Sukoran on a freelancer or other ship to take advantage of that property.
###### For cons, I'd say...
* Its speed now I won't give it a con for each speed metric because to be honest it's not slow by any means however it is not fast either. It's the middle of the road for everything. Actually that roll rate is pretty bad.
* It’s co-pilot seat is a bit disappointing. It doesn't have the ability for the co pilot to take over half the weapons. Your co-pilot would basically serve as an engineer. Unless you need to poop I guess.
* The view from the pilot seat while in flight mode takes up a large portion of the screen. Let me know if this bothers you as well.
* This is a big one. I talked about this in my loadout guide extensively. Its default weapons the Singe’s are pretty unique however they are bugged at the moment rendering them useless sometimes.
* Its missile payload is also disappointing with just 4 size 2 missiles. I would have thought it could carry more at its size.
* That brings me to the next one. Its top and bottom cross section is pretty but so it can be easy to hit from those angles.


### My Thoughts
Alright so SubliminaL what are your thoughts? There are alot of great things to say about the Avenger Stalker. You get a sabre as a temporary loaner, you get a really unique shield generator that you can use on the Avenger Stalker or any ship that fits a size 2 shield gen. Combine that with a FR-76 on a freelancer MIS and oooohhhh boy. And that quantum fuel tank. I can finally put that VK-00 on something. But it's also got a lot going against it. Its very unique weapons don't work, if they did they would be pretty awesome. And when you take them off they are gone until you do an account reset. They call it a light fighter but it handles like a medium fighter. And could definitely hold twice the missiles, but maybe that's balance. But with all of the issues it has I still love this ship. It's great to fly around the PU and do bounty hunter missions, exploring, box missions, showing a new player around the verse. Now I'm sure a lot of you are going to wonder if subliminal is this better than a sabre? Absolutely not. It's way too slow. It will get eaten alive by a gladius or arrow with a good pilot. Also in the future when the singe’s are fixed and fixed weapons are fixed, if they don't add the size three singe’s to stores you won't be able to take advantage of them because you'll need to use fixed weapons to be competitive. But with all that said due to everything I've mentioned i'll be keeping the Aegis in my fleet for the foreseeable future. I'll still have a sabre, sure it's not the one with the sexy paint job but it will do, and I get to play with the sukoran. Win win!
