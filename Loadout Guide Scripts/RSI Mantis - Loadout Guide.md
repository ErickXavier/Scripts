## Loadout Guide

### Preface
I'm going to give you my recommendations on how to loadout your RSI Mantis, and we're starting right now.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Welcome to "A Star Citizenâ€™s Loadout Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and In this guide we will discuss my recommendations for both weapons and components for your RSI Mantis. The best use of the Mantis in the games current state is a Pirate Fleet's Quantum Enforcer, or a Box Mission Courier. And today, were going to load it out to Excel at just that. My full review of the mantis will be coming soon so make sure your subscribed and have the bell clicked. I'm live right now! Head over to twitch to hang out and give me your thoughts on the Mantis and my loadout. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
Before we get into the loadout let me explain this builds premise. The RSI Mantis is a single seat interdiction ship capable of pulling targets our of quantum with its snare, and preventing quantum travel with its dampener. It isn't very well armored or armed, so it will need to be used along side a fleet or pirates. In addition it's atmospheric flight is excellent so it is great for running box missions. A stealth build for the Mantis will only limit its visibility to around 4500m away best case. So I don't think its worth it. If you are only doing box missions and want to go stealth anyway follow my loadout guide for the 315p.

### Components
Let's Start with the Power Plant, the component that gives all of the other components power. The standard power plant on the Mantis is the size 1, grade 3, Military Class, Regulus, with over 2,100 max power draw per second and a 13.75sec draw request time. This suffers from a low maximum power draw, a long draw request time, and most importantly not being able to provide enough power for the stock build or my complete build. So were going to be adding the trusty JS-300. Its grade 1,  Military Class, has almost 3,700 max power generation/sec and a fast 10s draw request time. This will add 1,500 max power draw and reduce the time it takes to reach that max power draw down to 10 seconds. This is a better power plant in every way. The JS-400 will set you back just around 20,000 aUEC, and can be found at these locations.

Let's discuss its coolers, these are used to cool our components. The standard coolers on the Mantis are the size 2, grade 3, Civilian Class, Frost Star EX Coolers with a max cooling rate of 4,200kilos/sec, and a draw request time of 15 seconds. These coolers have more than enough cooling capacity but have a pretty long request time. However after doing some testing There doesn't seem to be any reason to upgrade coolers if they have a high enough cooling rate. So I recommend keeping these. If you want to upgrade them anyway I recommend adding CoolCores, they are Grade 3, Industrial Class, with a cooling rate of 8,000kilos/sec, and a draw request time of 10 seconds. I don't recommend the SnowPacks even though they are better because of their cost to performance. And remember there is no evidence to show that even these cool cores will change performance. One CoolCore will set you back almost 60,000 aUEC, and can be found at these locations.

Before we get to the shields. Make sure you check out the link to this loadout at Erkul.Games, I have a link in the description that will take you to this unique loadout. It even tells you the prices and locations of where to find these items in the verse. Remember to head over to the Channel Discord to see my updated loadouts. We have a community of over 1,200 citizens who like to discuss ships, loadouts, components, weapons, and more. Click the link in the Description.

Now for its shield generator that protects our ship and these components. The Mantis's stock shield generators are the Size 2, grade 3, Civilian Class, 5MA Chimalli Shield Generators with an HP pool of almost 22,000, a 137hp/s regen rate, a 50% min physical absorption, a 0s dmg delay, a 15s dwn delay, and a 7.5s draw request time. Chimalli's have a decent pool but suffer from a low regen rate, and a long down delay.  Were going to be adding the trusty FR-76s, they are grade 1 Military Class, with an HP pool of almost 25,000, 310hp/s regen rate, 50% min physical absorption, a 0s dmg delay as well, a 8.25s dwn delay, and an 8s draw request time. This will give you more shield pool, and provide a much quicker regen rate. Another win-win over the stock loadout. It should be noted that there is a better shield combo in my opinion. If you own either a Banu Defender or Esperia Prowler pairing one FR-76 with a Sukoran from those ships is great. The Sukoran has 100% Ballistic Resistance so it will need to be taken completely down before you can take hull damage. Unfortunately if you don't own either of these ships there is no way to get access to the Sukoran. One FR-76 will set you back almost 25,000 aUEC and can be found at these locations.

And lastly the Quantum Drive that will help you get to the stores that sell these components faster. The standard QT drive on the Mantis is the size 2, grade 3, Civilian Class, Odyssey, with a 124Mm/s quantum speed, an 10.9/Mm fuel requirement, a 5s spool up, and a 18s cooldown time. This drive is pretty slow but has a pretty long range. In the games current state, I only need to be able to make a trip from PO to MicroTech and back without needing to refuel. I recommend using the Crossfield. The Crossfield is Grade 3, Military Class, has a 235Mm per second quantum speed, a 20.7/Mm fuel requirement, a 2.25sec second Spool Up and a 21.6sec cooldown time. This will cut the Trip from PO to MT in half. The Crossfield will run you about 60,000aUEC can be found at these locations.

### Weapons
Now let's talk about its stock weapons and my recommendations. The Mantis is equipped with 2 pre gimballed size 3 weapon hardpoints on each side. Each hardpoint has a Size 3 Tarantula GT-870 Mark 3 Ballistic Cannon. One Tarantula does 294 alpha damage, times 80rpm, for a total of 392dps, and a whopping 3,100-meter range, it has 720 rounds that would deplete in 540s of continuous fire. I actually like these guns. If you use them make sure you take advantage of their range, These are great for taking out slower, larger targets, or smaller targets before they get in close. If you prefer Energy Weapons id recommend using the CF-337 Laser Repeaters. This will alleviate the need to rearm and would be better against small, up-close, fast moving enemies.

Up top on the turret we have 2 size 2 hardpoints with 2 M4A Laser Cannons. One M4A does 183 alpha damage, times 75rpm, for a total of 229dps, and a 2,300-meter range. Id prefer to have faster firing weapons on this turret since most of its engagements will be up close. And since the pilot weapons have so much range lets add the short range, high DPS, NDB-28 Neutron Repeaters. One NDB 28 does 126 alpha damage, times 170rpm, for a total of 356dps, and a short 1,300-meter range. If you'd like more range id recommend the CF-227s. The Neutron Repeaters will cost you over 7,500aUEC each and can be found at these locations.

Underneath each wing we have a MSD-423 Missile Rack with 2 Arrester IIIs. One Arrester Is size 3, Cross Section, does 4,200 damage, has a 3.5s lock time, and a 9,000m lock range. These are great for larger targets and for striking from a long range. And I prefer Cross-section due to its lack of counter measures so ill keep them. We also have a MSD-322 Missile rack with 2 Ignite IIs. Ignites are size 2 Infrared, do 3,700 damage, have a 1.5s lock time, and a 5,700m lock range. As I said earlier I prefer Cross-section so ill add a couple of StrikeForce IIs. One StrikeForce is Size 2, does 3,800 damage, has a 2.4s lock time, and a 4,800m lock range. An honorable mention would be Rattler IIs, that are more useful for smaller faster moving targets. The StrikeForce IIs will cost you 1,300aUEC each and can be found at these locations.

### Debriefing
These recommendations are just that, my recommendations, and are not the best for every situation. If you agree or disagree let me know in the comments, or share your loadout over in the Subliminal's Channel discord. If you don't have about 200,000 aUEC to spend on all this at once I would buy them in the following order. The most important thing here are the power plant due to the stock one not being able to handle the rest of this loadout. Followed by the shields. If you do have access to the Sukoran you can probably get away with keeping the stock power plant. As far as 3.10 is concerned since this ship comes pre gimballed this loadout should be viable even after its release. I recommend regardless of skill level or fixed weapons being fixed you'll want to use auto gimbals on the Mantis because it comes gimballed anyway..
