# RSI Mantis
## Loadout Guide

### Preface
I'm going to give you my recommendations on how to loadout your RSI Mantis, and we're starting right now.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Welcome to "A Star Citizenâ€™s Loadout Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and In this guide we will discuss my recommendations for both weapons and components for your RSI Mantis. The best use of the Mantis in the games current state is a Pirate Fleet's Quantum Enforcer, or a Box Mission Courier. And today, were going to load it out to Excel at just that. My full review of the mantis will be coming soon so make sure your subscribed and have the bell clicked. I'm live right now! Head over to twitch to hang out and give me your thoughts on the Mantis and my loadout. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
Before we get into the loadout let me explain this builds premise. The RSI Mantis is a single seat interdiction ship capable of pulling targets our of quantum with its snare, and preventing quantum travel with its dampener. It isn't very well armored or armed, so it will need to be used along side a fleet or pirates. In addition it's atmospheric flight is excellent so it's great for running box missions. A stealth build for the Mantis will only limit its visibility to around 4500m away best case. So I don't think its worth it. If you are only doing box missions and want to go stealth anyway follow my loadout guide for the 315p. Also be sure to stay tuned to the end where I will show you an example of how to properly use the Mantis to dampen targets while participating in pirate activities.

### Components
Let's Start with the Power Plant, the component that gives all of the other components power. The standard power plant on the Mantis is the size 1, grade 3, Military Class, Regulus, with over 2,100 max power draw per second and a 13.75sec draw request time. This suffers from a low maximum power draw, a long draw request time, and most importantly not being able to provide enough power for the stock build or my complete build. So were going to be adding the trusty JS-300. Its grade 1,  Military Class, has almost 3,700 max power generation/sec and a fast 10s draw request time. This will add 1,500 max power draw and reduce the time it takes to reach that max power draw down to 10 seconds. This is a better power plant in every way. The JS-300 will set you back around 20,000 aUEC, and can be found at these locations.

Let's discuss its coolers, these are used to cool our components. The standard coolers on the Mantis are the size 1, grade 3, Military Class, Bracer Coolers with a max cooling rate of 260kilos/sec, and a draw request time of 12 seconds. These coolers have more than enough cooling capacity but have a long request time. However after doing some testing There doesn't seem to be any reason to upgrade coolers if they have a high enough cooling rate. So I recommend keeping these. If you want to upgrade them anyway I recommend adding Zero Rush's, they are Grade 2, Competition Class, with a cooling rate of 230kilos/sec, and a draw request time of 3 seconds, these offer less capacity but can get to that full capacity in just 3 seconds. But remember there is no evidence to show that upgrading Coolers past their required cooling rate, will effect performance. One Zero Rush will set you back over 16,000 aUEC, and can be found at these locations.

Before we get to the shields. Make sure you check out the link to this specific loadout at Erkul.Games, there is a link in the description. It even tells you the prices and locations of where to find these items in the verse. Remember to head over to the Channel Discord to see my updated loadouts. We have a community of over 1,200 citizens who like to discuss ships, loadouts, components, weapons, and more. Click the link in the Description.

Now for its shield generator that protects our ship and these components. The Mantis's stock shield generators are the Size 1, grade 3, Military Class, AllStop Shield Generators with an HP pool of 5,400, a 270hp/s regen rate, blocks a minimum of 50% of ballistic fire, a 5.25s dmg delay, a 7.5s dwn delay, and a 12s draw request time. AllStop's have a decent pool but suffer from an average regen rate, damage delay, down delay and request time.  Were going to be adding the trusty FR-66s, they are grade 1 Military Class, with an HP pool of over 6,000, a 306hp/s regen rate, blocks a minimum of 50% of ballistic fire, has a 3.85s dmg delay, a 5.5s dwn delay, and an 10s draw request time. This will give you more shield pool, and provide a much quicker regen rate. Another win-win over the stock loadout. One FR-66 will set you back over 18,000 aUEC and can be found at these locations.

[comment]: # (It should be noted that there is a better shield combo in my opinion. If you own either a Banu Defender or Esperia Prowler pairing one FR-76 with a Sukoran from those ships is great. The Sukoran has 100% Ballistic Resistance so it will need to be taken completely down before you can take hull damage. Unfortunately if you don't own either of these ships there is no way to get access to the Sukoran.)

And lastly the Quantum Drive that will help you get to the stores that sell these components faster. The standard QT drive on the Mantis is the size 1, grade 3, Civilian Class, Beacon, with a 253Mm/s quantum speed, an 18.6/Mm fuel requirement, a 2.25s spool up, and a 12s cooldown time. This drive is fast but has a terrible range, it isn't even capable of making it from PO to Hurston. In the games current state, I only need to be able to make a trip from PO to MicroTech without needing to refuel. I recommend using the Atlas. The Atlas is Grade 1, Civilian Class, has a 152Mm per second quantum speed, a 7.5/Mm fuel requirement, a 5.1sec second Spool Up and a 8.7sec cooldown time. This drive is one of the fastest drives that can make that trip. The Atlas will run you almost 18,000aUEC can be found at these locations.

### Weapons
Now let's talk about its stock weapons and my recommendations. The Mantis is equipped with 2 fixed size 3 weapon hardpoints on each side. Each hardpoint has a Size 3 FL-33 Laser Cannon. One FL-33 does 300 alpha damage, times 75rpm, for a total of 375dps, and a whopping 3,500-meter range. The range of these is awesome but I don't think its important for this ship. To use this ship for assisting a pirate operation you will want to stay very close to the target to make sure id doesn't slip you dampener range. Since your going to be close and shooting at larger targets why not take advantage of the High DPS NDB-30 Neutron Repeaters. One NDB 30 does 200 alpha damage, times 160rpm, for a total of 532dps, and a short 1,300-meter range. That right folks for the fist time in history I'm going fixed. Not because 3.10 is around the corner and fixed weapons may be great again, but because your are in a small nimble ship that will be primarily firing at large enemies. If you're using this for boxed missions combat should be avoided at all costs but id still use these too. NDB-30 Neutron Repeaters will run you almost 14,000aUEC each and can be found at these locations.

Tucked inside the fuselage we have a MSD-322 Missile Rack with 2 Dominator IIs. One Dominator Is size 2, Electro Magnetic, does 3,900 damage, has a 1.7s lock time, and a 6,000m lock range. On the other side we have another MSD 322 with 2 Ignite II's, One Ignite II is size 2, Infrared, does 3,700 damage, has a 1.5s lock time, and a 5,700m lock range. These are great for striking from a long range. I usually prefer crosssection but if were going to be this close to a ship with backup lets go for a quick lock time and temporary blindness for the target. I'll add a few Rattler IIs. One Rattler is Size 2, does 3,500 damage, has a 1.26s lock time, and a 4,500m lock range. An honerable mention would be StrikeFore II's because of their range and damage. One Rattler II will cost you 35aUEC each and can be found at these locations.

### Debriefing
While I'm debriefing this loadout watch this clip from Captain Berks's stream. Pay attention to the mantis. You can't miss its glowing red ball. These are just that my recommendations, and are not the best for every situation. If you agree or disagree let me know in the comments. If you don't have about 100,000 aUEC to spend on all this at once I would buy them in the following order. The most important thing here is the power plant due to the stock one not being able to handle the stock loadout let alone this one. Followed by the shields. As far as 3.10 is concerned since fixed weapons are getting a buff not using gimbals will just be even better. If you doing box missions and avoiding conflict you could get away with not upgrading the weapons. To see more of this Berks check the clip in the description. I will also be featuring it in my buyers guide with audio.
