## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Drake Herald and we’re starting right after this intro.

### Introduction
Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Drake Herald or lack there of. And we’ll compare those features amongst competing ships, so you can make an informed buying decision. In this review, I’ll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats, review pros and cons, and give you my thoughts on how CIG can make the Herald Great... for the first time. If you haven't seen it already after this review check out my loadout guide for the Drake Herald in the info card above, and on the end screen. Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

*New citizens, can use my referral code on screen or the link in the description to reserve their 5000aUEC in the PU, no pledge necessary.

### Overview
The Herald is a data runner spacecraft sold by Drake Interplanetary. It is an unusually specialized design for Drake, focusing entirely on the process of securely storing, transmitting, and moving data as quickly as possible. The Herald is built with an armored computer core and an STA-M6A1 high power broadcast array that allows for long range transmission. They are used by a variety of corporations and by independent contractors who specialize in data running missions.
Drake Interplanetary is a Human spacecraft manufacturer headquartered on Borea. They design, manufacture and sell spaceships in the Star Citizen universe. Their ships have a characteristically robust and geometrical design that utilizes many low-tech materials. Drake's target group also includes militias and pirates. The former CEOs Jan and Jon Dredge cultivated the outlaw image from the beginning of the company, which raised controversies about Drake's responsibility for pirate-related crimes.

*The 300 Series are four ships manufactured by Drake Jumpworks. They are all built with additional focus on luxury and comfort. Each ship has its own purpose and primary focus. There is the Basic luxury touring model 300i, the explorer variant Herald, the specifically designed for combat 325a, and the racing oriented variant the 350r.*

As of today, the Herald is NO LONGER for sale on the pledge store, when it was it sold for $85.
It is available as a loaner to Mercury Star Runner Owners alongside the Freelancer Base.
And The Herald is available for sale at Levski's Teach's Ship Shop for almost 1.2mil aUEC. But is not available to rent. Now that you know a little bit more about the Drake Herald let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. On the nose you’ll notice its size 3 hardpoint with a gimballed size 2 Gatling equipped. Inside of these silos we have 4 size 1 missiles. Here we have what looks like a side entrance but is actually a false door. Can someone tell why of all the ships this is the only one that has a door on the right side. This looks like where data pods can be stored and released. This flap that is labeled SATA M6A1 is actually the high powered broadcast array for long range data transmission that we talked about earlier. Under this little T-Rex arm wing is a gimballed size 1 Gatling. These are just one of many maneuvering thrusters. Around the rear we have what I'm pretty sure are the greatest main thruster to hull size ratio of any ship jpg or otherwise in the verse. This is utter insanity. On the Starboard side we have access to the cabin.

### Interior
Let's climb inside. Straight ahead we have a weapon rack. The Herald is full of server racks instead of my mentioning every time I look at one ill just tell you know there are racks on racks on racks in here. This control terminal is where all the magic will happen. For now its got 4 MFDs. Not sure what these are but reading the label if you don't know what your doing while handling them you could die. So that's nice. Below this death box is where you can lay you head to sleep. Here we have some emergency supplies and a sink for washing off that rona. Yay Space Shitter! Here we have some storage. Were back at the exit now so lets head back to the flight deck. Oh more storage and emergency supplies. The Herald does not have the new building blocks UI but I expect it in the upcoming 3.10 patch. It does have 6 MFDs and a 2D radar though. As usual for a drake ship there is no ejection feature. But don't worry if they can catch you and you get attacked in this you'd be dead before you could eject anyway.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, some ships said to have data running capabilities. And some explorers. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The Drake Herald weighs in at over 66,000kg | 4th Place
* It fits in at 24m in length | 6th Place
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | Ties in last place with a few other ships on this list
* Has a Max Crew Size of 2 | Ties in 5th place with the terrapin
* Carries 583qfu | Ties in last again
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 174m/s | Third Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,361m/s | This is the fastest afterburner speed of any ship currently in the verse
* But It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 48d/s | 7th Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 48d/s as well | 6th Place These are just a little bit faster than the freelancer DUR
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 72d/s | And just comes in dead last
* It has a Total Hull HP of just over 5,500 | 8th Place
* It shoots peas with a Default Pilot DPS of 744 | 6th place
* The Herald does not have a manned turret.
* It has a decent combined missile payload of just over 23,000 | 4th Place
* And the Drake Herald is available for sale in-game for almost 1,200,000aUEC | And takes the 4th spot.

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It fast as fuck! In one direction, that's forward.
* And it has decent missile payload.
* Now for some things we cant see on paper. It has room for some passengers and mission boxes in the cabin.
* It has amenities like a bed to log out in, a weapon rack, and a toilet.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* phhhh where do I begin. Its just my opinion but it should have a larger than basic hydrogen fuel tank. It seems like this ship should be long range.
* I'm not sure how this is possible but the fastest ship in the game is also one of the slowest in every other direction than forward. Were talking Yaw, Pitch, and Roll. And don't get me started on retro thrust.
* It has terrible Hull HP
* About as much firepower as an aurora
* I know i mentioned its missile payload as decent but its not even close to its concept. And to add insult to injury the missile racks can't be swapped out for ones that hold larger missiles.

### My Thoughts
If you like to skip this RANT the time stamp is on screen. This is the only flight ready JPG ship. It has absolutely no use right now. I built a stealth loadout for it thinking It could be used to smuggle boxes or sneak up and cause a distraction but even with its super low EM OF 700ish its IR of over 6,000 makes it visible from space. This may be accurate considering its massive thruster but it does have a stealthy hull appearance.
I've heard commenters say that ships handle like bricks and until this it was just a figure of speech. This actually does handle exactly like how I would expect a giant rocket propelled brick would fly. Look at this. I am not stroking my T-1600M I promise. And if you are considering taking it up on its MAX speed this is going to be your most effective way of coming to a stop, also I should have re-coupled here. I'm not normally one who gets mad at the difference between concept vs actual flight ready. But this has significantly less missiles than advertised sorry for you early backers. When designing my loadout I added 2 size three missiles in erkul. They have a 9,000km lock range and even with the herald being lit up like a Christmas tree it would have been capable striking from outside of its detection range. But nope the missile racks are locked to the MSD 341s that hold 4 size 1s with terrible lock ranges and low damage output. Speaking of damage output... actually let me just stop there. Let's talk about how this ship can become relevant in 3.10.1 with minimal
game development needed. First and most importantly give us the ability to hack com arrays with this. They just added prisons now its time to add more ways to stay out of them. I can't take credit for this found this idea somewhere on Reddit. This would make the Herald more relevant to the current game state than the Mantis. Recently missiles got a nerf you can only launch one missile per pod rather than dumping your full load at once. So with this logic the Herald could now have 2 more size 3 missile racks with per silo and still
not be OP in my opinion. Also allow us to put whatever size 3 rack we want please. And finally come up with some way un lore that these massive engines can idle in some sort of low energy mode so we can get a respectful IR signature to match the stealthy ascetics of the ship. As for its other issues like handling, DPS, and hull HP that's just balance and frankly fits the design of the ship. Even if we don't see these changes made when data running hits the PU this will
mostlikely be a viable ship with its
relatively low cost in the pledge store and in the game. Provided data running will be lucrative.
