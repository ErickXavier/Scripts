## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Drake Herald and we’re starting right after this intro.

### Introduction
Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Drake Herald or lack there of. And we’ll compare those features amongst competing ships, so you can make an informed buying decision. In this review, I’ll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats, review pros and cons, and give you my thoughts on how CIG can make the Herald Great... for the first time. If you haven't seen it already after this review check out my loadout guide for the Drake Herald in the info card above, and on the end screen. Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
The Herald is a data runner spacecraft sold by Drake Interplanetary. It is an unusually specialized design for Drake, focusing entirely on the process of securely storing, transmitting, and moving data as quickly as possible. The Herald is built with an armored computer core and an STA-M6A1 high power broadcast array that allows for long range transmission. They are used by a variety of corporations and by independent contractors who specialize in data running missions.
Drake Interplanetary is a Human spacecraft manufacturer headquartered on Borea. They design, manufacture and sell spaceships in the Star Citizen universe. Their ships have a characteristically robust and geometrical design that utilizes many low-tech materials. Drake's target group also includes militias and pirates. The former CEOs Jan and Jon Dredge cultivated the outlaw image from the beginning of the company, which raised controversies about Drake's responsibility for pirate-related crimes.

*The 300 Series are four ships manufactured by Drake Jumpworks. They are all built with additional focus on luxury and comfort. Each ship has its own purpose and primary focus. There is the Basic luxury touring model 300i, the explorer variant Herald, the specifically designed for combat 325a, and the racing oriented variant the 350r.*

As of today, the Herald is NO LONGER for sale on the pledge store, when it was it sold for $85.
It is available as a loaner to Mercury Star Runner Owners alongside the Freelancer Base.
And The Herald is available for sale at Levski's Teach's Ship Shop for almost 1.2mil aUEC. But is not available to rent. Now that you know a little bit more about the Drake Herald let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. On the nose you’ll notice its size 3 hardpoint with a gimballed size 2 Gatling equipped. Inside of these silos we have 4 size 1 missiles. Here we have what looks like a side entrance but is actually a false door. Can someone tell why of all the ships this is the only one that has a door on the right side. This looks like where data pods can be stored and released. This flap that is labeled SATA M6A1 is actually the high powered broadcast array for long range data transmission that we talked about earlier. Under this little T-Rex arm wing is a gimballed size 1 Gatling. These are just one of many maneuvering thrusters. Around the rear we have what I'm pretty sure are the greatest main thruster to hull size ratio of any ship jpg or otherwise in the verse. This is utter insanity. On the Starboard side we have access to the cabin.

### Interior
Let's climb inside. Straight ahead we have a weapon rack. The Herald is full of server racks instead of my mentioning every time I look at one ill just tell you know there are racks on racks on racks in here. This control terminal is where all the magic will happen. For now its got 4 MFDs. Not sure what these are but reading the label if you don't know what your doing while handling them you could die. So that's nice. Below this death box is where you can lay you head to sleep. Here we have some emergency supplies and a sink for washing off that rona. Yay Space Shitter! Here we have some storage. Were back at the exit now so lets head back to the flight deck. Oh more storage and emergency supplies. The Herald does not have the new building blocks UI but I expect it in the upcoming 3.10 patch. It does have 6 MFDs and a 2D radar though. As usual for a drake ship there is no ejection feature. But don't worry if they can catch you and you get attacked in this you'd be dead before you could eject anyway.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, some ships said to have data running capabilities. And some explorers. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The Drake Herald weighs in at over 66,000kg | 4th Place
* It fits in at 24m in length | 6th Place
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | Ties in last place with a few other ships on this list
* Has a Max Crew Size of 2 | Ties in 5th place with the terrapin
* Carries 583qfu | Ties in last again
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 174m/s | Third Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,361m/s | This is the fastest afterburner speed of any ship currently in the verse
* But It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 48d/s | 7th Place These are just a little bit faster than the freelancer DUR
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 48d/s as well | 6th Place
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 72d/s | And just comes in dead last
* It has a Total Hull HP of just over 5,500 | 8th Place
* It shoots peas with a Default Pilot DPS of 744 | 6th place
* The Herald does not have a manned turret.
* It has a decent combined missile payload of just over 23,000 | 4th Place
* And the Drake Herald is available for sale in-game for almost 1,200,000aUEC | And takes the 4th spot.

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It fast as fuck! In one direction, that's forward.
* And it has decent missile payload.
* Now for some things we cant see on paper. It has room for some passengers and mission boxes in the cabin.
* It has amenities like a bed to log out in, a weapon rack, and a toilet.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* phhhh where do I begin. Its just my opinion but it should have a larger than basic hydrogen fuel tank. It seems like this ship should be long range.
* I'm not sure how this is possible but the fastest ship in the game is also one of the slowest in every other direction than forward. Were talking Yaw, Pitch, and Roll. And don't get me started on retro thrust.
* It has terrible Hull HP
* About as much firepower as an aurora
*

### My Thoughts
Alright so SubliminaL what are your thoughts? The Herald has a lot of things going for it, its fast, nimble, has good cargo for its size and price, its got everything you need inside of it. Sounds like a great combat ship right? Nope its nose hardpoint is stuck with a tractor canon that can't be removed for a weapon, or another utility item like a mining head that actually has gameplay features implemented. So it has 33% less firepower than the base model in this series. And all that for what?, an extra 4 SCU of cargo over the base? How much money can you make with just 12scu. Well your conventional legal commodities wouldn't get the profit that I'm looking for. But... there is a less talked about commodity VICE that has up to a 40% profit. The catch is, its illegal, and can only be bought and sold in limited quantities, plus the locations where VICE are sold are on the surfaces of moons in unmarked locations, requiring you to find them manually without navigation. Sounds like a lot of risk. Well no not if its done right. A lot less risk than filling up a caterpillar with a half a mil of inventory and risking loosing it all to a 30k. And selling VICE can be an excellent way to make money for new to intermediate players, or anyone with not so much capital. Its because of this I can now highly recommend this ship to players who would want to use it to PASSIVLY smuggle drugs or explore in stealth. Speaking of stealth I have created a stealth loadout for the Herald, check it out in the info card above after this review. Using stealth you can scout these drug locations for players, and avoid being seen by authorities who might scan you for contraband. However outside of this specific gameplay there are better ships. If you want combat, look toward a 325a or gladius. Or a Cutlass Black or Freelancer for Cargo.

Let me show you how easy it is to make a WiDoW run, from GrimHex, the asteroid station outside Yela, head toward OM-6. Once there, look for this turkey head and aim toward these mountains toward the top of the moon. Fly straight in. Once here look for these landmarks, and aim for this crater. Inside you'll find Jumptown.  Land and head inside. Walk up to this terminal and buy WiDoW. If there isn't enough you could also buy other forms of VICE marked by the skulls in triangles here. If this is the case I'd recommend Altruciatoxin as it can also be sold back at GrimHex. I don't have enough capital to fill the full 12 SCU of cargo but that's ok. Also it is not recommended to invest no more than 30% of your capital but my jump to safety is real short and why not, I now have 44aUEC and a prayer. Leave here, fly back to GrimHex, head toward the elevators and go down. Go to the hallway with the green neon light to the left of it. Head toward this console, click sell, and sell your load. Boom you just made 40% profit. If I had 121,000aUEC of capital to spend to fill up the 12SCu. I could have sold it for 168,000aUEC making 47,000aUEC of profit for about 10 min of my time. That's good money. Now at this point GrimHex is going to no longer have demand for WiDoW for you or any other players. So you could do some other types of missions or start trading some of the less profitable VICE commodities while it cools down. Usually about 20min or so will do. Now doing this exact route is not the only way to sell VICE, this is one of 6 or more secret locations that can only be found by manually navigating to them or by accepting certain missions. You can find guides on YouTube on how to find these locations. Do not, I repeat Do not use the guides I made about a year ago. Since then with PlanetTech V4 the planets look totally different. I will update these guides once the Heightmap Improvements are complete in the 3.10 patch. After that I may make a guide on how to buy and sell these VICE commodities. The site I've been using to check prices and plan my routes is gallog.co, to use gallog click trade > Trading > Trade. Select your ship, pick the location you'd like to pickup from, input the amount of aUEC your comfortable investing, go into filters, check this box for hidden locations, And click apply. And that's it, looks like we can sell the WiDoW at GrimHex or at CRU-L4 at a hidden terminal. These are just a couple of VICE commodities from just one location. Use Gallog to check out other vices and locations.
