### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Origin 315p and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Origin 315p. And we’ll compare those features amongst competing ships, so you can make an informed buying decision. In this review, I’ll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats, review pros and cons, give you my thoughts on the 315p, and show you how to do a drug run. If you haven't seen it already after this review check out my loadout guide for the Origin 315p in the info card above, and on the end screen. Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. New citizens, can use my referral code on screen or the link in the description to reserve their 5000aUEC in the PU, no pledge necessary. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.


### Overview
The 315p is a variant of the 300 touring spacecraft developed by Origin Jumpworks. Added to the lineup in 2930, the variant was built with enhanced engines for improved power output and a bespoke communications system designed by Chimera Communications. 315p are generally used as vanguards in support of larger exploratory teams or by individual owners who are looking to explore in a craft with Origin’s signature style. Origin Jumpworks is a personal luxury spacecraft manufacturer based on Terra. The move to Terra is recent; until 2913, the company was located on Earth, and had a policy only to use materials created in the Sol System to manufacture its 600 line of ships. Since the move, it has changed its outsourcing policy to accept components from across the UEE. The 300i and 890 JUMP are among its bestselling designs. The 300 Series are four ships manufactured by Origin Jumpworks. They are all built with additional focus on luxury and comfort. Each ship has its own purpose and primary focus. There is the Basic luxury touring model 300i, the explorer variant 315p, the specifically designed for combat 325a, and the racing oriented variant the 350r. As of today, the 315p is for sale, and upgrade on the pledge store for $65.

[comment]: <> (It is available as a loaner to Origin Merchantman Owners alongside the Drake Caterpillar, By the way this is a great package)
And The 15p is available for sale at Area 18’s Astro Armada for over 880,000 aUEC. But is not available to rent. Now that you know a little bit more about the Origin 315p let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. On the nose you’ll notice its size 3 hardpoint with a tractor bean equipped. This is not operational at the time of this recording. Above it you can see the iconic 300 series headlights that I love. Moving on underneath we have the first cargo bay that holds 8 of the 12 SCU. Inside of its wing you can see its retro thrusters. Under the wings we have a size three hardpoint with a gimballed size 2 weapon. This is not the stock loadout by the way. And we have an MSD212 Missile Rack that hold 1 size 2 missile. Underneath in the rear we have its second and final cargo bay that hold the remaining 4 SCU. Around the rear we have its massive main HDMI Port. The starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's climb inside. Straight ahead we have a head. Heading to the rear on the starboard side we have a bed to log out in. The clock and digital picture frame you see here are addons I purchased. The bed actually features a functional MFD. Let me remove my chest plate to show you. All the way in the back we have a non functioning armor locker, a functional weapon rack, and some fancy pinkey out wine glasses that every origin ship should have. We have a minifridge, coffee machine, music box, sink, and food processor. All of these are addons including the ones on the bed. I purchased with real money, and these items, at this time, have no gameplay function. Before we head toward the flight deck, check out this moon roof. The HUD has not been updated to the new building blocks UI but we should see that in 3.10. The pilot seat has 4 MFDs and a radar. The 315p Does have an ejection system.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, most of the 300 variants, some light freighters, some light explorers, and full explorers. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The Origin 315p weighs in at almost 70,000kg | 5th Place
* It fits in at 27m in length | Ties in 3rd Place with the 300 series
* Totes 12scu of Cargo | 3rd Place
* Has a Max Crew Size of 1| Ties in Last place with half the ships on this list
* Carries 830qfu | 4th place This is great
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 210m/s | 2nd only to the fighter variant 325a
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,223m/s | 2nd Place again
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 68d/s | Ties in 2nd Place with the 300i
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 68d/s as well | Ties in 2nd with the 3 hundo again
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 230d/s | Ties in 1st Place with the 300 series
* It has a Total Hull HP of just over 6,000 | Ties in 6th place with the titan
* It shoots peas with a Default Pilot DPS of 896 | Ties in 8th place
* The cutty and freelancer DUR are the only ships on this list with turrets
* It slings pooh with a combined missile payload of just over 7,000 | 8th Place
* And the Origin 315p is available for sale in-game for almost 900,000aUEC | And takes the 4th spot.

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It has 12scu of cargo this is great for a ship of its size and cost.
* Its 830qfu is allows you to add faster less efficient drives that can still make the trip from one end of Stanton to the other without stopping to refuel.
* It has a fast SCM speed. This will come in handy when degradation comes in. You can go faster without overworking components and thrusters.
* It's Max Speed is great as well. Allowing you to outrun opponents. This is great considering the lack of firepower the 315p possesses.
* The 315ps Max Yaw, Pitch, and Roll are excellent too. Again allowing your to outmaneuver and escape conflict.
* Now for some things we cant see on paper. It has plenty of room for passengers and mission boxes in the cabin. That's right folks no need to try and store the package in the buggy cargo hold or flip your ship upside down to get a box in the cabin just climb up the ladder with it. Personally I like to store them on top of the counter.
* It has amenities like a bed to log out in and a weapon rack. Also in the future you should be able to use the kitchen to make food and beverages, and when your done with breakfast and coffee you can take a space shit.
* Plus all of these pros makes in the perfect drug smuggling ship. We'll talk more about that in a sec.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* Its size, at 27 meters in length its pretty large. Its also very wide as well. You don't want to get caught from the top or the bottom.
* Its missile payload is pretty disappointing with only 2 size 2 missiles
* Not having a third hardpoint cripples is combat abilities.
* If you thought that was bad enough they added insult to injury buy adding grade 3 stealth components to it that reduce its combat performance further.
* And I hate the nighttime glare from the cabin lights. You should be able to turn that off.

### My Thoughts
Alright so SubliminaL what are your thoughts? The 315p has a lot of things going for it, its fast, nimble, has good cargo for its size and price, its got everything you need inside of it. Sounds like a great combat ship right? Nope its nose hardpoint is stuck with a tractor canon that can't be removed for a weapon, or another utility item like a mining head that actually has gameplay features implemented. So it has 33% less firepower than the base model in this series. And all that for what?, an extra 4 SCU of cargo over the base? How much money can you make with just 12scu. Well your conventional legal commodities wouldn't get the profit that I'm looking for. But... there is a less talked about commodity VICE that has up to a 40% profit. The catch is, its illegal, and can only be bought and sold in limited quantities, plus the locations where VICE are sold are on the surfaces of moons in unmarked locations, requiring you to find them manually without navigation. Sounds like a lot of risk. Well no not if its done right. A lot less risk than filling up a caterpillar with a half a mil of inventory and risking loosing it all to a 30k. And selling VICE can be an excellent way to make money for new to intermediate players, or anyone with not so much capital. Its because of this I can now highly recommend this ship to players who would want to use it to PASSIVLY smuggle drugs or explore in stealth. Speaking of stealth I have created a stealth loadout for the 315p, check it out in the info card above after this review. Using stealth you can scout these drug locations for players, and avoid being seen by authorities who might scan you for contraband. However outside of this specific gameplay there are better ships. If you want combat, look toward a 325a or gladius. Or a Cutlass Black or Freelancer for Cargo.

Let me show you how easy it is to make a WiDoW run, from GrimHex, the asteroid station outside Yela, head toward OM-6. Once there, look for this turkey head and aim toward these mountains toward the top of the moon. Fly straight in. Once here look for these landmarks, and aim for this crater. Inside you'll find Jumptown.  Land and head inside. Walk up to this terminal and buy WiDoW. If there isn't enough you could also buy other forms of VICE marked by the skulls in triangles here. If this is the case I'd recommend Altruciatoxin as it can also be sold back at GrimHex. I don't have enough capital to fill the full 12 SCU of cargo but that's ok. Also it is not recommended to invest no more than 30% of your capital but my jump to safety is real short and why not, I now have 44aUEC and a prayer. Leave here, fly back to GrimHex, head toward the elevators and go down. Go to the hallway with the green neon light to the left of it. Head toward this console, click sell, and sell your load. Boom you just made 40% profit. If I had 121,000aUEC of capital to spend to fill up the 12SCu. I could have sold it for 168,000aUEC making 47,000aUEC of profit for about 10 min of my time. That's good money. Now at this point GrimHex is going to no longer have demand for WiDoW for you or any other players. So you could do some other types of missions or start trading some of the less profitable VICE commodities while it cools down. Usually about 20min or so will do. Now doing this exact route is not the only way to sell VICE, this is one of 6 or more secret locations that can only be found by manually navigating to them or by accepting certain missions. You can find guides on YouTube on how to find these locations. Do not, I repeat Do not use the guides I made about a year ago. Since then with PlanetTech V4 the planets look totally different. I will update these guides once the Heightmap Improvements are complete in the 3.10 patch. After that I may make a guide on how to buy and sell these VICE commodities. The site I've been using to check prices and plan my routes is gallog.co, to use gallog click trade > Trading > Trade. Select your ship, pick the location you'd like to pickup from, input the amount of aUEC your comfortable investing, go into filters, check this box for hidden locations, And click apply. And that's it, looks like we can sell the WiDoW at GrimHex or at CRU-L4 at a hidden terminal. These are just a couple of VICE commodities from just one location. Use Gallog to check out other vices and locations.
