# RSI Mantis
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the RSI Mantis and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. I'm live right now! Head over to twitch to hang out and give me your thoughts on the Mantis. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the RSI Mantis. In this review, we'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, show you how to activate its snare (Psst it doesnt work), show you an effective way to use its dampener, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and give you my thoughts on the Mantis. If you haven't seen it already after this review check out my loadout guide for the RSI Mantis in the info card above, and on the end screen. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

*New citizens, can use my referral code on screen or the link in the description to reserve their 5000aUEC in the PU, no pledge necessary.*

### Overview
The RSI Mantis is a single-seat interdiction ship, capable of pulling targets out of Quantum travel using "Quantum Enforcement". Lightly armed and armored, the Mantis is designed to work in tandem with more heavily-armed Law Enforcement or Pirates to confront the captured ships.
Roberts Space Industries is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells spaceships, vehicles, ship components, and space suits. It is one of the oldest modern Human space corporates that stretches back all the way to mankind's first steps into the stars.[1] Incorporated in 2038, RSI was responsible for the development of the Quantum drive that ushered in the colonization of the galaxy.
As of today, the Mantis is available for sale and upgrade on the pledge store for $150.
For owning a Mantis you receive a Aurora LN light Fighter as a loaner.
As of today the Mantis is not available for sale in game, nor for rent. Now that you know a little bit more about the RSI Mantis let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. As you can see the Mantis has a beautiful white paint job. You can just tell from here that the Mantis has a great view from the flight deck. Underneath on each side we have a size 3 hardpoint. FYI this is not the stock loadout. Ill leave a link to my loadout guide on the end-screen. Taking a step back up top we can just barely see the MSD-322 missile rack with size 2 missiles. The Starboard side has one as well. I really like the style of the mantis. Back here we can see its main thrusters. The Starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's head inside. To enter into the Mantis simply click this button. Then reach up and click this button or turn around to use the same one. As you can see the cabin is pretty spacious. On the port side we have the restroom, equipped with you guess it, a space shitter, and even a space bidet for you fancy folks. On this side we also have a bed to log out in. On the Starboard side we have a food processor and coffee machine. Next to this we have 2 component housings. And some monitors displaying some spaceship stuff. On the floor we have another 1, 2, and 3 component housings. Lets head toward the flight deck. on each side we have some spaceship stuff that doesn't seem to have a purpose. Lets have a seat. The pilot seat has the New building blocks UI we should be seeing on all ships in 3.10. It also has 4 MFDs and a 3d radar. To our right there is a button to turn on the QED. The Mantis does not have an ejection system.

### Quantum Snare
Lets take a look at how to use the snare. To make an effective trap its best to fly to the location from which you want to catch people and head toward a common destination. I've headed to Hurston and will be heading toward crusader. I'll start the jump and then cancel it just after the "Entered Jurisdiction UEE" pops up. Now I'm safe to activate the snare without fear of getting a crimestat. Now turn on your QED, the back hatch will open and glow red. Now that the QED is on you can either activate the dampener that will prevent anyone from quantum traveling out. Or you can charge the snare. Let's do that. You can see the snare is charging. Once it is ready you can either cancel the charge or initiate the snare. Lets initiate. Now your snare is activated. Anyone in quantum within a 20,000 mile radius will snared. Well once the mechanic is fully implemented in the game. As of right now you cannot snare in the PU. If you'd like to see the results of me testing this, check out the link to this clip in the description. Now for the Quantum dampener. I'm sure you can figure out how to activate it. What I want to show you is how to effectively use it to assist a fleet of pirates in the games current state. here is a clip from Captain Berk's stream from a few days ago. Pay attention to the Mantis. You can't miss it it's glowing red. I have added a link to this clip from Berk's stream in the description. Be sure to check him out if you'd like to see more pirate gameplay.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, the Cutlass Blue, a Starter, box mission ships, and some e-warfare ships. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The RSI Mantis as well as the Pisces show to have 0 mass in the game files this could be why their atmospheric flight is so fast.
* It fits in at 30m in length | 6th Place
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | Ties in last place
* Has a Max Crew Size of 1 | Ties in last again
* Carries 583qfu | And you guessed it ties in last place
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 168m/s | 8th Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,220m/s | 3rd Place
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 62d/s | 4th Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 64d/s | 3rd Place
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 175d/s | 3rd Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of just over 6,800 | 6th Place
* It shots peas with a Default Pilot DPS of just 750 | 7th place
* The Mantis does not have a turret
* It has a combined missile payload of over 15,000 | Ties in 5th place
* And the RSI Mantis is not available for sale in-game | for almost 1,700,000aUEC | And takes the 6th spot.

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It's very light weight. Im sure this is a bug interested to see if its fixed in 3.10.
* It's Max Speed is pretty good although I think it could be even faster as an interceptor.
* Now for some things we cant see on paper. It has plenty of room for some passengers and mission boxes.
* It has amenities like a beds to log out in, a toilet, food processor, and coffee maker.
* and if your considering this over a cutty blue, the mantis is the only ship in the game with a quantum snare. Just remember it doesn't work in 3.9 here's hoping it will work on 3.10 since they gave it to us this month as a subscriber ship.
* Another great use for the Mantis is to run box missions because it's pretty quick in atmosphere.
* Also not just in atmosphere but in space its pretty nimble. Good pitch yaw and roll rates.
* It also stops on a dime.
* And it has a great view from the cockpit.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* Its SCM speed is pretty low. So even though its fast you will be over working it to get to those speeds. Well have to see how its effected in 3.10 and will full degradation is in.

These next couple of things are cons but please note that they are to be expected for the singular focus of this ship. But still need to be mentioned.
* With only 2 size three hardpoints you not going to want to be engaging the targets you snare.
* It's also pretty fragile. So again avoid combat at all cost while your alone.

### My Thoughts
What are my thoughts? Excluding the fact that its exclusive feature is not currently usable. I think the mantis is perfect for the roll at hand there are alot of things that it has going great for it. But should you buy one? Well let me tell you why you should. If you are looking to prevent quantum for pirating reasons. It is one of 2 ships capable of doing this. Also if tou like running box missions the ships speed and handling in atmosphere is pretty good. But the later is not a good enough reason to spend $150 on this ship. There are better box runners ships at much lower prices. With that being said the only reason to by one is for assistint a pirate fleet. Otherwise your money is best spent elsewhere.
