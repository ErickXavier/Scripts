## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the MISC Freelancer and we’re starting right after this intro.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the MISC Freelancer or lack there of. And we’ll compare those features amongst competing ships, so you can make an informed buying decision. Well actually for no you have it for free! In this review, I’ll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats, review pros and cons, and give you my thoughts on the Freelancer. If you haven't seen it already after this review check out my loadout guide for the MISC Freelancer in the info card above, and on the end screen.  Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

*New citizens, can use my referral code on screen or the link in the description to reserve their 5000aUEC in the PU, no pledge necessary.*

### Overview
The Freelancer is a multi-role transport spacecraft developed by MISC and was the first vessel to be constructed as part of a unique lend-lease agreement with the Xi'an government. Initially marketed as an efficient long-haul merchant ship for private enterprises, the Freelancer quickly became the ship of choice for dedicated explorers.
Musashi Industrial and Starflight Concern (MISC) is a spacecraft manufacturer headquartered in Fujin City on Saisei (Centauri III). Founded in 2805 after a merger between Hato Electronics Corporation and the Musashi Lifestyle Design Unit spinoff of Acorn Limited, MISC primarily produces transport and industrial utility spacecraft, such as the Freelancer and the Starfarer, but has also been expanding into the racing market with the Razor.
The ship's hull is sold in several variants that have been adapted for various alternate roles like the Freelancer DUR exploration ship, the Freelancer MAX enhanced cargo ship, and the Freelancer MIS carrier-based missile boat.
As of today, the Freelancer is available for sale and upgrade on the pledge store for $110, and is available in the Freelancer game package for $125.
It is currently available as a temporary loaner for everyone due to a few bugs, It is also available to Hull A& B, Mercury Star Runner, And Vulcan Owners Owner's.
And The Freelancer is available for sale at Lorville's New Deal for almost 1.7mil aUEC. And it is available for rent at Area 18 and Lorville's rental stations. Now that you know a little bit more about the MISC Freelancer let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. The paint your seeing is the stock paint or I guess in this case lack of paint. Storm Surge and black are also available. Although I actually have the black equipped right now but am currently experiencing a bug. Let me know in the comments if you are too. Up front we have the Daft Punk helmet style look for the freelancers nose. This is a thruster you'll see these around. Above the landing gear we have the side entrance. Her we have the huge proprietary Dual size 3 turret found on the freelancer series. This one is equipped with 2 size three ballistic cannons. Up here on the main engines we have what looks like a speaker diaphragm but I think its a retro thruster. Moving toward the rear. Under each wing we have a size 4 missile rack and a size 3 missile rack, each holding 2 missiles. Around the rear we have its dual main thrusters. In concept the these actually rotated down to be used as VTOL thrusters like the cutlass black but I think they nixed that idea. Oh almost forgot up here is the rear manned turret. Also around the rear we have the entrance to the cargo hold. The starboard side is identical to the port side. I was going to give you one last look but this happened and I couldn't leave it out.

### Interior
Let's head inside. Through the cargo bay doors we first have the rear manned turret. This turret has 4 MFDs and a 2 D radar. I'm not a fan of its view. Heading back down, on the Starboard side we have Radar 1, Shield 1, Avionics 1, Radar 2, Power 1. On the Port Side we have the Quantum Drive, both coolers, Avionics 2, Shield 2, and life support. This cargo hold is big enough to fit 54 of the 66SCU. A Tumbril Cyclone will also fit but its a tight fit anything smaller will fit with ease. Continuing on we have another room that holds the remaining 12scu of cargo and the docking collar. Next we have the living quarters. On the port side we have what looks like a food processor and beverage maker. Next is the airlock and side entrance we saw earlier. Turning around on the starboard side we have a non functional workstation. To our right we have a head. It has a shower, sink, and a space shitter but I haven't been able to extend it. Heading toward the flight deck we have 4 beds. Fun fact these also are the freelancers escape pods. Entering into the flight deck we have 4 seats. In the rear on the port and starboard side we have engineering stations that each have 1 functional MFD. Lets skip to the co-pilot seat. The co-pilot seat has a couple of terribly placed MFDs unless you have head tracking and a few well placed ones. Let's check out the pilot seat. The pilot seat has a pretty similar setup except the middle MFD is replaced by the HUD and Radar. The freelancer series does not have the new UI yet. There are no ejection seats in the flight deck.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, all of the freelancer variants, Some Competitors and some starter cargo ships. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The MISC Freelancer weighs in at almost 210,000kg | 5th Place
* It fits in at 38m in length | Ties in 6th Place with the rest of the freelancers
* Totes 66scu of Cargo | 3rd Place
* Has a Max Crew Size of 5 | Ties in 1st place with the freelancers and andromeda.
* Carries 2500qfu | Ties in 3rd place
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 154m/s | Ties in 6th place Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,005m/s | Ties in 6th place Place again
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 47d/s | Ties in 6th place Place again
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 47d/s as well | Ties in 5th place Place
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 74d/s | Ties in 6th place Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of just over 19,000 | 4th Place
* It blasts its way in with a Default Pilot DPS of 1,568 | 4th place
* It shoots through the enemy with a Turret DPS of 916 | Ties in 3rd place
* It has a decent combined missile payload of almost 32,000 | 6th Place
* And the MISC Freelancer is available for sale in-game for almost 1,700,000aUEC | And takes the 6th spot.

It's important to take notice that if you are comparing some of the larger cargo ships the freelancer access better in rankings in this example I have some light cargo ships that sku the performance rankings. The freelancer would certainly rank higher without these ships added to the list.

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It fast as fuck! In one direction, that's forward.
* And it has decent missile payload.
* Now for some things we cant see on paper. It has room for some passengers and mission boxes in the cabin.
* It has amenities like a bed to log out in, a weapon rack, and a toilet.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* phhhh where do I begin. Its just my opinion but it should have a larger than basic hydrogen fuel tank. It seems like this ship should be long range.
* I'm not sure how this is possible but the fastest ship in the game is also one of the slowest in every other direction than forward. Were talking Yaw, Pitch, and Roll. And don't get me started on retro thrust.
* It has terrible Hull HP
* About as much firepower as an aurora
* I know i mentioned its missile payload as decent but its not even close to its concept. And to add insult to injury the missile racks can't be swapped out for ones that hold larger missiles.

### My Thoughts
If you like to skip this RANT the time stamp is on screen. This is the only flight ready JPG ship. It has absolutely no use right now. I built a stealth loadout for it thinking It could be used to smuggle boxes or sneak up and cause a distraction but even with its super low EM OF 700ish its IR of over 6,000 makes it visible from space. This may be accurate considering its massive thruster but it does have a stealthy hull appearance.
I've heard commenters say that ships handle like bricks and until this it was just a figure of speech. This actually does handle exactly like how I would expect a giant rocket propelled brick would fly. Look at this. I am not stroking my T-1600M I promise. And if you are considering taking it up on its MAX speed this is going to be your most effective way of coming to a stop, also I should have re-coupled here. I'm not normally one who gets mad at the difference between concept vs actual flight ready. But this has significantly less missiles than advertised sorry for you early backers. When designing my loadout I added 2 size three missiles in erkul. They have a 9,000km lock range and even with the herald being lit up like a Christmas tree it would have been capable striking from outside of its detection range. But nope the missile racks are locked to the MSD 341s that hold 4 size 1s with terrible lock ranges and low damage output. Speaking of damage output... actually let me just stop there. Let's talk about how this ship can become relevant in 3.10.1 with minimal
game development needed. First and most importantly give us the ability to hack com arrays with this. They just added prisons now its time to add more ways to stay out of them. I can't take credit for this found this idea somewhere on Reddit. This would make the Freelancer more relevant to the current game state than the Mantis. Recently missiles got a nerf you can only launch one missile per pod rather than dumping your full load at once. So with this logic the Freelancer could now have 2 more size 3 missile racks with per silo and still
not be OP in my opinion. Also allow us to put whatever size 3 rack we want please. And finally come up with some way un lore that these massive engines can idle in some sort of low energy mode so we can get a respectful IR signature to match the stealthy ascetics of the ship. As for its other issues like handling, DPS, and hull HP that's just balance and frankly fits the design of the ship. Even if we don't see these changes made when data running hits the PU this will
mostlikely be a viable ship with its
relatively low cost in the pledge store and in the game. Provided data running will be lucrative.
