# Understanding weapons and components
## Components Guide
### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know to choose components for any ship and we're starting right now.

### Introduction
Thanks to all the support from Patrons and Channel Members it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated.
Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Guide to the Galaxy" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and In this guide we will be taking a quick look into the different metrics used to classify most of the components and weapons in star citizen. Understanding what components to equip on your ship can be daunting. In this guide I will try to explain my Understanding of Size, Grade, Class, EM, IR, and Draw Request Time that are unique to almost all components and weapons in star citizen. I may be completely wrong about some of the info in this guide and that's OK because we are all learning throughout our journey in Star Citizens Alpha that is constantly changing. Check the pinned comment for updated info. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
Let's talk briefly about some common metrics that all components have. Some of this information is copied from the wiki at over at starcitizen.tools. The RSI website is not recommended as a source for current and updated information on ships, components, or weapons. I highly recommend Erkul.Games your up-to-date info that is gathered straight from the games data.

### Size
The First is size. Component sizes range from 0 to 4.

* Size 0: Components are usually found on very small vehicles like rovers, buggies and bikes.
* Size 1: components are for small ships
* Size 2: for medium
* Size 3: for large
* size 4: Components are found on capital class ships like the 890 jump. This size is currently unavailable for purchase at stores in the verse.

The size of a ship's compatible components are determined by the manufacturer of the ship and are typically uniform across all 4 components. There are some instances where a ship can have multiple sized components but it's rare, some examples would be the Prospector, Banu Defender and 600i.

### Grade
Next we have the grade of a component, it can range from grade A to D. A Grade value is the easiest way to determine how well a component performs compared to other components in its size.

* Grade D - Is the lowest grade, generally found on NPC or AI ships and some Drake ships
* Grade C - Are the standard item for most ships by default
* Grade B - Is a good upgrade to performance
* Grade A - Has the best possible performance

### Class
Then we have a components class, this is something that is not fully fleshed out in the game's current state. There are five classes

* Military - Has the best overall at that item’s functionality, at the expense of emissions and cost.
* Civilian - Is the most common, with a wide range of behaviors to suit cost, options to approximate all * other categories but not as specific.
* Stealth - Have vastly reduced signatures & consumption at the expense of functionality.
* Industrial - Have reliably high output and low wear, with high emissions.
* Competition - Has higher performing than military but at the expense of durability and stealth, performance over everything.

A Components Class will be very important when degradation is implemented into the game. In addition it has also been stated that Class will be limited to a ships hull. For example a racing ship like the M50 will be limited to Competition class components.

### Stealth
Next we have our stealth parameters Power to EM and Temperature to IR.

* Your EM signature is a measurement of your ship's Electromagnetic visibility. All components and weapons produce an EM signature and will broaden the distance that your ship will be visible to other ships' radar.
* IR Signature is a measurement of your ships Infrared visibility. The more heat your ship generates the higher your IR sig and just as EM the higher the number the further your ship will show up on another ship's radar.
*
It's also important to know that the distance a ship is able to see you is also dependent upon the size of the detecting ship's own radar. For example Ships with size 2 scanners can detect whichever is greatest between your ships EM or IR with formula researched by Legacy Fleet. Taking the greater of the 2 values multiply it by .5 for size 1 radars and by .75 for larger radars. This will be your detection range in kilometers. That's enough of stealth, well cover stealth more in a later video.
